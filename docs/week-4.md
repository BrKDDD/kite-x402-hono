# Week 4: non-blocking stream cleanup

Continue the Kite x402 Bun/Hono wrapper in the same repository.

## Problem

Version 0.3.0 awaited stream cancellation when rejecting oversized bodies and
upstream redirects. An asynchronous producer cleanup that never resolves could
hold the entire request and concurrency slot indefinitely. A rejecting cleanup
could also replace the intended error. Already-aborted reads released the reader
lock but did not cancel the source.

## Change and evidence

Initiate cancellation without awaiting producer cleanup, handle cleanup rejection,
cancel unfinished reads once, and always release the reader lock. Successful
reads keep their exact bytes and do not cancel completed streams.

Nine regression tests cover pending and rejecting cancellation for oversized
requests, oversized responses and redirects; they verify original HTTP errors,
no settlement or payment receipt, health availability and capacity recovery using
an unpaid challenge. Additional cases cover already-aborted reads, abort during a
pending read, and successful multi-chunk reads at the exact size limit.

Against the previous source, seven of these nine tests fail. With the fix all nine
pass. Test payment verification is simulated; no real on-chain payment is claimed.
The fix is included in version 0.3.1; registry publication is verified separately.

Cancellation is best-effort, not proof the producer released external resources.
An injected stream must manage its own resources. This change neither aborts an
in-flight settlement nor retries payment or undoes an upstream action.
