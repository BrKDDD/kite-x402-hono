# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Make rejected-body and redirect stream cleanup non-blocking so stalled producer
  cancellation cannot retain a request slot. Preserve original errors when cleanup fails.
- Cancel unfinished reads, including already-aborted requests, and release reader locks.
- Add nine regression tests for stalled/rejected cleanup, capacity recovery, aborts
  and byte-preserving successful reads.

## 0.3.0

- Add `FACILITATOR_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 90000, range 1–300000) and validate
  environment and programmatic configuration while preserving older Config objects.
- Apply the official SDK HTTP abort mechanism to facilitator capability discovery,
  payment verification and settlement, including response headers and bodies.
- Add seven real HTTP timeout tests covering failure responses, concurrency-slot
  recovery, health availability and absence of automatic payment retries.
- Update English/Chinese documentation, CLI help and the environment example.

The timeout applies per HTTP attempt; SDK initialization backoff may extend the
whole request. Custom facilitator clients manage their own deadlines. Settlement
timeout leaves the payment outcome unknown and does not guarantee no charge.

## 0.2.0

- Bound the complete payment lifecycle with `MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` (default
  64). Excess requests receive a non-cacheable 503 `service_busy` and Retry-After
  before payment verification. Slots remain held until settlement completes.
- Release slots on success and failure; keep health checks independent.
- Add deterministic concurrency, settlement, initialization and recovery tests.
- Include Chinese documentation and updated configuration/CLI guidance.
- Make the CI package installation check follow the package version automatically.

This release adds a default concurrency cap. Operators needing a different limit
can set a value from 1 to 10000. The limit is per app instance, not distributed;
it does not implement payment deduplication or automatic payment retries.

## 0.1.0

- Initial Kite mainnet/testnet Bun/Hono x402 proxy, payment lifecycle tests,
  bounded bodies, credential filtering and installable npm package.
